# Neural-Language-Model

In this project I have implemented a neural language model both at Word and Character Level.
For Deep Learning tools Keras Library in Python is used.

This repository contains three code files
1.) Word Language Model
2.) Character Language Model
3.) Sentence Generator

There are two supporting files for the Sentence Generator code.
1.) Trained Word Language Model
2.) One tokenizer file

Finally there is a Report on the project
